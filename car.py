class Car(Serviceable):
    """
    Represents a car object that can be serviced.

    This class provides a blueprint for creating car objects with an engine, battery, and tires.
    It implements the Serviceable interface, allowing it to be checked for servicing needs.

    Attributes:
        engine (Engine): The engine of the car.
        battery (Battery): The battery of the car.
        tires (Tires): The tires of the car.

    Methods:
        needs_service(): Determines if the car needs servicing.

    Usage:
        car = Car(engine, battery, tires)
        if car.needs_service():
            print("The car needs servicing.")
        else:
