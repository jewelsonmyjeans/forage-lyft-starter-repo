    Represents a Spindler battery that implements the Battery interface.

    This class provides a concrete implementation of a Spindler battery, adhering to the Battery interface.

    Attributes:
        SERVICE_LIMIT_DAYS (int): The maximum number of days before the battery needs servicing.
        current_date (date): The current date.
        last_service_date (date): The date when the battery was last serviced.

    Methods:
        __init__(current_date, last_service_date): Initialize a SpindlerBattery object.
        needs_service() -> bool: Determine if the spindler_battery battery needs servicing.

    Usage:
        spindler_battery = SpindlerBattery(current_date, last_service_date)
