    Represents a Carrigan tires that implements the Tires interface.

    This class provides a concrete implementation of the Tires interface for Carrigan tires.
    It contains an attribute for the list of tire wear values and a method to determine if the tires need servicing.

    Attributes:
        tires (List[float]): A list of tire wear values representing the wear levels of each tire.

    Methods:
        needs_service(): Determines if the Carrigan tires need servicing.

    Usage:
        tires = CarriganTires([0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.5])
        if tires.needs_service():
            print("The Carrigan tires need servicing.")
